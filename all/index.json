To just list the features:\n Add one or more of the following to a faction's file (what they do is quite self-explanatory):  FACTION.canSeeWaypoints = true FACTION.canAddWaypoints = true FACTION.canRemoveWaypoints = true FACTION.canUpdateWaypoints = true   Players can still remove/update their own waypoints without their faction having Remove/Update permissions. Makes it easy to add waypoints script-wise with a global library function (in case you for example want to create a waypoint where a player died). Waypoints can have some text. Waypoints can have different colors and can be made to last for a certain amount of time. Waypoint markers draw through walls and include a distance to them in meters. It is also possible to add waypoints without a distance marker. Waypoints will visually change a bit when a player can see the actual location. Players joining will see waypoints created before they joined if they should see them. Everything updates quite nicely. No texture download needed, waypoint is just drawn with lines and rectangles.
